## Pedagogical Courses
I have taken three courses in university pedagogy of total of 8 ECTS (roughly 6 weeks, full time studtying): 

* Undervisning på Högskolan (Teaching at the University), Umeå University 
* Teori om Lärande (Theory of Learning), Umeå University
* Problembaserat Lärande (Problem-based learning), Linköping University


## Teaching  

Teaching has been primarily in:

* Research Methods & Basic Statistics
* Cognitive Psychology (attention, perception, & working memory)
* Applied Cognitive Psychology (attention and perception)

The majority of lectures, seminars, lab demonstrations, supervision of group projects (both involving empirical and applied projects) and co-supervision of thesis' have been given at the Department of Psychology, Umeå University, Sweden (2014 - 2017). In addition to the previously mentioned teaching types, I have also held workshops, and supervised projects and thesis' at the Department of Behavioral Science and Learning, and the Department of Computer Science and Information, Linköping University (2019 - ). Teaching have been carried out digitally (e.g., through Zoom, using online learning platforms such as LISAM at Linköping university) and physically (e.g., live lectures). I have experience of digital examination such as quizzes, hand-ins in learning platforms but also traditional examination forms.

At Umeå University and Linköping University, I have so far taught 950  and 662 clock hours, respectively (total = 1612 hours). Topics of the supervised projects and thesis' has all been in cognitive science (i.e., human-computer interaction, psychology, and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning). For an overview, of my teaching responsibilities see Table 1.
