I was responsible for arranging the monthly \href{https://liu.se/linnecentrum-head/en}{HEAD} seminar series 2019-09 - 2020-12. This included contacting national, and international, researchers, booking flights, and hotels. I also booked suitable rooms, created and printed posters, as well as set up equipment for online streaming. 

I was also the elected chairperson of the Ph.D. students council of the Department of Psychology, Umeå University.
